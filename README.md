# Joint Transmit Beamforming and Phase Shifts Design with Deep Reinforcement Learning

PyTorch implementation of [the paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9110869). The paper solves a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) Assisted Multiuser Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) System problem with the deep reinforcement learning algorithm of [DDPG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971).

The algorithm is tested, and the results reproduced on a custom RIS assisted Multiuser MISO environment.
